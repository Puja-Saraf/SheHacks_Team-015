        <p>While she is busy portraying several roles and looking after the world, SheCare is here to look after her.</p>
        <p>This website has been designed to celebrate that spirit of a warrior every woman posseses with pride. This is the one stop destination to make everyone aware of the many diseases a woman goes through without even knowing about it. While spreading awareness about the many unknown ailments, the website also provides an interactive blog for people to connect with each other and talk about their experiences and struggles, or ask questions.
            The website also features surviver stories to keep other fighters motivated, and a nearest centre locator, to enable people track down the healthcare facility closest to them.</p>
