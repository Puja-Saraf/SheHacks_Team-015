            First Trimester : A baby grows rapidly during the first trimester (weeks 1 to 12). The fetus begins developing their brain, spinal cord, and organs. The baby’s heart will also begin to beat.During the first trimester, the probability of a miscarriage is relatively high. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), it’s estimated that about 1 in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage, and that about 85 percent of these occur in the first trimester.

            Second trimester:During the second trimester of pregnancy (weeks 13 to 27), your healthcare provider will likely perform an anatomy scan ultrasound.This test checks the fetus’s body for any developmental abnormalities. The test results can also reveal the sex of your baby, if you wish to find out before the baby is bornYou’ll probably begin to feel your baby move, kick, and punch inside of your uterus.After 23 weeks, a baby in utero is considered “viable.” This means that it could survive living outside of your womb. Babies born this early often have serious medical issues. Your baby has a much better chance of being born healthy the longer you are able to carry the pregnancy

            Third trimester: During the third trimester (weeks 28 to 40), your weight
             gain will accelerate, and you may feel more tired.Your baby can now sense 
             light as well as open and close their eyes. Their bones are also formed.As 
             labor approaches, you may feel pelvic discomfort, and your feet may swell. 
             Contractions that don’t lead to labor, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions, 
             may start to occur in the weeks before you deliver.

        <h3 class = "cause">Pregnancy and urinary tract infections (UTIs):</h3>
        <span class = "stress"></span>
        <p id = "cause">
            
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common complications women experience during pregnancy. Bacteria can get inside a woman’s urethra, or urinary tract, and can move up into the bladder. The fetus puts added pressure on the bladder, which can cause the bacteria to be trapped, causing an infection
Symptoms of a UTI usually include pain and burning or frequent urination. You may also experience:

        </p>
        <pre class = "lpoints">
            1)Cloudy or blood-tinged urine
            2)Pelvic pain
            3)Lower back pain
            4)Fever
            5)Nausea and vomiting

            Nearly 18 percent of pregnant women develop 
            a UTI. You can help prevent these infections 
            by emptying your bladder frequently, especially 
            before and after sex.Drink plenty of water to stay 
            hydrated. Avoid using douches and harsh soaps 
            in the genital area

        </pre>
        <pre class = "rpara">
            Pregnancy prevention:
            1)Intrauterine devices (IUDs): They’re currently the most effective form of birth control. 
            The downside is that they don’t prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
            2)The pill and other hormonal birth control methods: Birth control pills, patches and the 
            vaginal ring work by controlling the hormone levels in a woman’s body. They’re available by 
            prescription.Actions that can reduce the effectiveness of these methods include forgetting to use 
            them as prescribed. Effectiveness rates that mention “typical use” account for these 
            types of human errors.
            3)Condoms and other barrier methods: Condoms, diaphragms, and sponges are convenient 
            and inexpensive forms of birth control that can be bought without a prescription.
            They’re most effective when used correctly every time you have sexual intercourse. 
            If you’re relying on these barrier methods to avoid getting pregnant, also consider 
            using an additional method of contraception such as spermicide or a birth control pill.
            4)Emergency contraception:Several morning-after pills are available, both over the counter 
            and by prescription. These pills aren’t intended as regular forms of birth control. Instead, 
            they can act as a backup if you have unprotected sex or forget to use your regular form of 
            birth control.They must be used within 120 hours (five days) of sexual contact to be effective. 
            Some pills are most effective when taken within 72 hours (three days).

            Pregnancy or PMS:
            The symptoms of early pregnancy can often mimic those of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). 
            It may be difficult for a woman to know if she’s pregnant or simply experiencing the 
            onset of another menstrual period.
            Some common symptoms of both PMS and early pregnancy include:
            1)Breast pain
            2)Bleeding
            3)Mood changes
            4)Fatigue
            5)Food sensitivities
            6)Cramping

        </pre>
        <pre class = "fpoints">
            Pregnancy diet:
            A healthy pregnancy diet should be much the same as your typical healthy diet, 
            only with 340 to 450 additional calories per day. Aim for a healthy mix of foods, 
            including:
            1)Complex carbohydrates
            2)Protein
            3)Vegetables and fruits
            4)Grains and legumes
            5)Healthy fats

            Vitamins and minerals: Pregnant women require larger amounts of some vitamins and minerals than women who aren’t pregnant. 
            Folic acid and zinc are just two examples.

            Pregnancy and exercise: Exercise is essential to keeping you fit, relaxed, and ready for labor. Yoga stretches in particular 
            will help you stay limber. It’s important not to overdo your stretches, however, as you could risk injury.Other good exercises 
            for pregnancy are gentle Pilates, walking, and swimming.

            Pregnancy and labor:Sometime after your fourth month of pregnancy, you may begin to experience Braxton-Hicks contractions, 
            or false labor. They’re completely normal and serve to prepare your uterus for the job ahead of real labor.
            
            Early labor:Labor contractions are generally classified as early labor contractions and active labor contractions. 
            Early labor contractions last between 30 and 45 seconds. They may be far apart at first, but by the end of early labor, 
            contractions will be about five minutes apart.
            Your water might break early during labor, or your doctor may break it for you later on during your labor. When the 
            cervix begins to open, you’ll see a blood-tinged discharge coating your mucous plug.

            Active labor:In active labor, the cervix dilates, and the contractions get closer together and become more intense.
            If you’re in active labor, you should call your healthcare provider and head to your birth setting. If you’re unsure 
            whether it’s active labor, it’s still a good idea to call and check in.

            Labor pain: Pain will be at its height during active labor. Have a discussion with your doctor about your preferred 
            method of dealing with pain.You may choose drug-free measures such as meditation, yoga, or listening to music.
            Analgesics, such as meperidine (Demerol), dull the pain but allow you to retain some feeling. Anesthetics, such 
            as an epidural, prevent certain muscle movement and completely block the pain.

            Prenatal and postpartum depression:
            All psychiatric drugs cross the placenta and reach the developing fetus. Thus, during 
            pregnancy, women need to understand how a given drug may affect the developing fetus. 
            But any possible risks of taking a medication need to be weighed against the risks of 
            not taking it. In some cases, untreated depression carries more risk than the drugs used 
            to treat this mood disorder.The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the 
            American Psychiatric Association recommend that clinicians offer psychotherapy and close 
            monitoring rather than medication for treatment of mild or moderate depression during 
            pregnancy. SSRIs can be used during the first trimester without significantly increasing 
            the risk of fetal heart defects or other major congenital malformations. Use later in 
            pregnancy may cause problems in the newborn. About 10% to 15% of new mothers 
            experience postpartum depression (within three to six months after delivery). 
            Sleep deprivation, the dramatic changes and stresses that accompany motherhood, 
            and shifts in hormones may all contribute. Treatment can improve the quality of 
            life for both the mother and her child.
